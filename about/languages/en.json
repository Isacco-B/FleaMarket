  "about_page_description": "Flea Market is a traveling festival that celebrates creativity and sustainability through handmade projects, creative recycling, eco-friendly products, design, art, illustration, and vintage items. It highlights the passion and talent of its exhibitors, many of whom are women who have reinvented themselves by turning their ideas into unique projects. Throughout the event, a variety of additional activities are organized, including workshops and craft sessions for children and adults, readings, acoustic concerts, and book exchanges. Each project at Flea Market tells a story, reflecting the dedication and passion of its creator. The festival is not just a showcase for unique products but also a movement that promotes sustainable and responsible practices, emphasizing the importance of reuse, recycling, and valuing handcrafted work. Flea Market is more than just an event; it is a celebration of creativity, sustainability, and personal transformation, with a strong focus on female empowerment."
