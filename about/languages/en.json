  "about_page_description": "Flea Market is an itinerant festival that celebrates creativity and sustainability through handmade projects, creative recycling, green products, design, art, illustration, and vintage items. Itâ€™s a space that highlights the passion and talent of its exhibitors, many of whom are women who have reinvented themselves, transforming their ideas into unique projects. During the exhibition are organized other activities such as workshops and labs for children and adults, readings, acoustic concerts, and book exchanges. Every project tells a story, reflecting the dedication and passion of those who conceived, designed, and created it. The festival is not just a showcase for unique products but also a movement that promotes sustainable and responsible practices, emphasizing the importance of reuse, recycling, and valuing artisanal work. Flea Market is more than an event; it is a celebration of creativity, sustainability, and personal transformation, with a strong focus on women's empowerment"
